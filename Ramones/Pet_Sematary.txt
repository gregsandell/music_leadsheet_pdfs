Pet Sematary chords by Ramones
[Intro]
D Em F (x2)

[Verse 1]
D         Em       F
Under the arc of a weather stain boards
D       Em      F       
Ancient goblins and warlords
D               Em         F
Come out of the ground not making a sound
D            Em       F
The smell of Death is all around
C                       Dm
And the night when the cold wind blows
C               Dm        Bb 
No one cares, nobody knows

[Chorus]
D                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
D               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again
D                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
D               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again

[Verse 2]
D          Em        F
Follow Victor to the sacred place
D          Em         F
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
D          Em         F
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
D       Em      F
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
C                      Dm
And the night when the moon is bright
C                   Dm         Bb
Someone cries, something ain't right

[Chorus]
D                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
D               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again
D                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
D               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again

[Break]
Bb D Bb C

[Verse 3]
D           Em        F
The moon is full, the air is still
D        Em       F
All of a sudden I feel a chill
D         Em        F
Victor is grinning, flesh is rotting away
D         Em       F
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
C                      Dm
And the night when the wolf cries out
C                Dm              Bb
Listen close and you can hear me shout

[Chorus]
D                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
D               C             Bb     C
I don't want to live my life again
D                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
D               C             Bb      C
I don't want to live my life again

[Outro]
    D    C    Bb   C
oh, no,   oh, no
               D           C      Bb    C
I dont want to live my life, not again
    D    C    Bb   C
oh, no,   oh, oh
               D           C      Bb     C
I dont want to live my life, not again
         D      C    Bb   C
oh, no, no, no
    D    C    Bb   C
